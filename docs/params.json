The `-v` flag shown above makes the Docker socket available inside the container running the script.\r\n\r\nNote that the script only works against images that exist in your local image repository (the stuff you see when you type `docker images`). If you want to generate a Dockerfile for an image that doesn't exist in your local repo you'll first need to `docker pull` it.\r\n\r\n## Docker Example\r\n\r\n[![Docker Repository on Docker Hub](https://img.shields.io/docker/cloud/automated/laniksj/dfimage.svg?style=flat)](https://hub.docker.com/r/laniksj/dfimage)\r\n[![Docker Repository on Quay](https://quay.io/repository/laniksj/dfimage/status \"Docker Repository on Quay\")](https://quay.io/repository/laniksj/dfimage)\r\n[![Docker Pulls](https://badgen.net/docker/pulls/laniksj/dfimage)](https://hub.docker.com/r/laniksj/dfimage)\r\n[![Docker Layers](https://images.microbadger.com/badges/image/laniksj/dfimage.svg)](https://microbadger.com/images/laniksj/dfimage \"Get your own image badge on microbadger.com\")\r\n\r\nHere's an example that shows the official Docker ruby image being pulled and the Dockerfile for that image being generated.\r\n\r\n    $ docker pull laniksj/dfimage\r\n    Using default tag: latest\r\n    latest: Pulling from dfimage\r\n\r\n    $ alias dfimage=\"docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock --rm laniksj/dfimage\"\r\n\r\n    $ dfimage imageID\r\n    FROM buildpack-deps:latest\r\n    RUN useradd -g users user\r\n    RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y bison procps\r\n    RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y ruby\r\n    ADD dir:03090a5fdc5feb8b4f1d6a69214c37b5f6d653f5185cddb6bf7fd71e6ded561c in /usr/src/ruby\r\n    WORKDIR /usr/src/ruby\r\n    RUN chown -R user:users .\r\n    USER user\r\n    RUN autoconf && ./configure --disable-install-doc\r\n    RUN make -j\"$(nproc)\"\r\n    RUN make check\r\n    USER root\r\n    RUN apt-get purge -y ruby\r\n    RUN make install\r\n    RUN echo 'gem: --no-rdoc --no-ri' >> /.gemrc\r\n    RUN gem install bundler\r\n    ONBUILD ADD . /usr/src/app\r\n    ONBUILD WORKDIR /usr/src/app\r\n    ONBUILD RUN [ ! -e Gemfile ] || bundle install --system\r\n\r\n## How Does It Work?\r\n\r\nWhen an image is constructed from a Dockerfile, each instruction in the Dockerfile results in a new layer. You can see all of the image layers by using the `docker images` command with the (now deprecated) `--tree` flag.\r\n\r\n    $ docker images --tree\r\n    Warning: '--tree' is deprecated, it will be removed soon.

In fact, if you do a `docker inspect` on any one of these layers you can see the instruction that was used to generate that layer.\r\n\r\n    $ docker inspect 011aa33ba92b\r\n    [{\r\n      . . .\r\n      \"ContainerConfig\": {\r\n        \"Cmd\": [\r\n            \"/bin/sh\",\r\n            \"-c\",\r\n            \"#(nop) ONBUILD RUN [ ! -e Gemfile ] || bundle install --system\"\r\n        ],\r\n        . . .\r\n    }]\r\n\r\nThe output above has been truncated, but nested within the _ContainerConfig_ data you'll find the Dockerfile command that generated this layer (in this case it was an `ONBUILD` instruction).\r\n\r\nThe _entrypoint.py_ script works by simply walking backward through the layer tree and collecting the commands stored with each layer. When the script reaches the first tagged layer (or the root of the tree) it stops and displays the (reversed) list of commands. If you want to generate the commands going all the way back to the root image layer you can use the `-f` flag to walk the entire tree.\r\n\r\n## Limitations\r\n\r\nAs the Python script walks the list of layers contained in the image it stops when it reaches the first tagged layer. It is assumed that a layer which has been tagged represents a distinct image with its own Dockerfile so the script will output a `FROM` directive with the tag name.\r\n\r\nIn the example above, the _ruby_ image contained a layer in the local image repository which had been tagged with _buildpack-deps_ (though it wasn't shown in the example, this likely means that _buildpack-deps:latest_ was also pulled at some point). If the _buildpack-deps_ layer had not been tagged, the Python script would have continued outputting Dockerfile directives until it reached the root layer.\r\n\r\nAlso note that the output generated by the script won't match exactly the original Dockerfile if either the `COPY` or `ADD` directives (like the example above) are used. Since we no longer have access to the build context that was present when the original `docker build` command was executed all we can see is that some directory or file was copied to the image's filesystem (you'll see the file/directory checksum and the destination it was copied to).\r\n\r\n## Extract\r\n\r\nIf you want to extract a file from a container run this:\r\n\r\n    docker run --rm --entrypoint cat imageName /path/to/file > filename\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n[![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License)\r\n\r\n## Donate\r\n\r\n[![Patreon](https://img.shields.io/badge/patreon-donate-red.svg)](https://www.patreon.com/laniksj/overview)\r\n",
