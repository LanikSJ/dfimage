# Cline Rules for GitHub Directory

## Global Project Rules (Auto-applied to all GitHub directory changes)

This file defines rules that Cline must follow for ALL changes made to files
in the GitHub directory (`.github/*`).

### Rule Enforcement Priority

1. **MANDATORY**: All rules in this `.github/.cline-rules` file take precedence
2. **REFERENCE**: Root `.cline-rules` file contains additional guidelines
3. **AUTO-APPLY**: These rules are checked before ANY file modification

### Markdown Compliance Requirements (MANDATORY)

- **ALL .md files in .github/ MUST pass markdownlint validation with ZERO
  errors**
- Run `markdownlint <filename>` on EVERY markdown file before considering changes complete
- Follow project's `.markdownlint.json` configuration (currently: 80 char
  line limit)
- Address ALL markdownlint issues immediately - no exceptions allowed
- Use `markdownlint --fix <filename>` for auto-fixable issues when available
- Validate markdown files in CI/CD pipelines where applicable

### GitHub-Specific Requirements

#### Templates and Workflows
- Ensure issue and pull request templates provide clear, actionable guidelines
- Include project-specific troubleshooting sections in templates
- Reference existing project documentation and standards
#### Documentation Standards
- .github/CONTRIBUTING.md must include:
  - Development environment setup instructions
  - Testing requirements and procedures
  - Documentation standards for new features
  - Project-specific contribution guidelines
#### Automation and CI/CD
- Project workflows must include automated testing stages
- Code quality checks must be integrated into CI/CD
- Release automation must be properly configured

### Quality Gates (MANDATORY)

**For ANY change made to `.github/*` files:**
1. ✅ Run markdownlint validation (if .md file)
2. ✅ Ensure project standards are followed (if applicable)
3. ✅ Verify contribution guidelines are up-to-date and accurate
4. ✅ Check that automation maintains project standards

### Error Prevention

- NEVER generate markdown that violates line length or formatting rules
- ALWAYS cross-reference with existing project practices before making changes
- ENSURE all links and references are valid and current
- VALIDATE that new requirements don't conflict with established workflows

### Reference Documentation

See root `.cline-rules` file for additional project-wide standards including:
- Project-specific standards
- Development requirements
- Quality guidelines

**RULE ENFORCEMENT**: Cline MUST read and apply these rules for EVERY GitHub
directory operation. Failure to comply results in automatic rejection of
changes.
